# Contributing to Netmaker UI
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use a [Github Flow variant](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the PR workflows pass.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the SSPL License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [SSPL License](LICENSE.txt) that covers the project, and requires you to sign a consent. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker-ui-2/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker-ui-2/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, steps to reporduce and if possible sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [This stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
I'm borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md)

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the [project's license](LICENSE.txt).
