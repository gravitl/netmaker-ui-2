# Netmaker UI release notes

## Netmaker UI v0.24.2

## Whats New

- Static enpoints and ports can now be set separately for hosts. This is useful for users who want to expose services on their hosts, on defined ports.
- Enhanced network setup wizard. The network setup wizard now supports more usecases: setting up internet gateways and how to connect a site to a network.

## What's Fixed/Improvements

- Improved failover experience. UX for setting the network failover host has been made more intuitive, with a badge easily identifying the acting failover host.
- Default RAC and Netclient download links to .exe versions rather than .msi counterparts.
- Reordered the network page tabs for better user experience. Host tab now shows first.
- Minor UI/UX bug fixes and improvements

## Known issues

- Graph page crashed when WebGL is not enabled. WebGL is required for the graph page to work.
