# Netmaker UI release notes

## Netmaker UI v0.24.0

## Whats New

- New OAuth users will now join a waiting list. Admins can approve or reject these users. This is to prevent unauthorized users from joining the server, improving security.
- Networks with over 50 hosts should now use NMCTL to manage ACLs. This is for better UX and also to circumvent performance issues.
- UI will now notify admins of any new version to the server. This is to help admins enjoy new features and fixes in subsequent releases.
- Instructions to add RAC mobile hosts to the network are now available in the UI. It can be accessed via the "Add new host" process.
- QR codes available for RAC mobile download. This is to make it easier for users to download the RAC mobile app by scanning.
